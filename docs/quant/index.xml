Alpha Excess returns you gain over the market.
Only available to you. Requires you to have an edge (information that&amp;rsquo;s not baked into the price already). Zero-sum game. If you gain, somebody loses. Short-lived.

Anything well-known is probably arbitraged away already (if it can be), by the time the info reaches you.</description></item><item><title>Fundamentals: Book Recommendations</title><link>https://itchingpixels.com/docs/quant/books/</link><pubDate>Sun, 19 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://itchingpixels.com/docs/quant/books/</guid><description>Book recommendations About investing in general: Gary Antonacci: Dual Momentum Investing

Investing in an index fund (eg. the S&amp;amp;P 500) is the “standard” passive strategy people use, but those who have done that experienced a 50% loss of their capital in the last 20 year multiple times. Depending on when you invest, your balance could be negative for 10 years.</description></item><item><title>Fundamentals: The reasons against discretionary investing</title><link>https://itchingpixels.com/docs/quant/the-reasons-against-discretionary-investing/</link><pubDate>Sun, 19 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://itchingpixels.com/docs/quant/the-reasons-against-discretionary-investing/</guid><description>The reasons against discretionary investing 0.
