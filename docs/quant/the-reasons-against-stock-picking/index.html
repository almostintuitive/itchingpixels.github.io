<strong>Fundamentals: The reasons against stock picking</strong>
<label for=toc-control><img src=/svg/toc.svg class=book-icon alt="Table of Contents"></label></div></header><article class=markdown><h1 id=the-reasons-against-stock-picking>The reasons against stock picking</h1><p>1. As a retail investor (with fees against you, and being an outsider), you have no obvious edge over the market. Everything that’s in the mainstream financial press is most probably baked into the price.</p><p>2. If something seems under- or overpriced to you, you probably don’t have all the info, and the market is most probably right.</p><p>3.

Even in hindsight, you’ll not be able to verify if the price went up or down because of your insight, or other factors. You can build up your ego in an up-market easily by seeing your assumptions frequently being validated, without benchmarking for total market returns or objectively evaluating the situation. The lack of reliable feedback leads to limited amount of learning, and stagnation (combined with inflated ego).</p><p>5. Mixing your personality (I like Crocs sandals, and their brand) with your investment decisions (therefore I’ll buy Crocs stock) is dangerous, as you can get into a situation where your ego is conflicting with your financial well-being. We’re all humans though - good luck detaching your personality from the rest of your decisions!</p></article><footer class=book-footer><div class="flex justify-between"><div><a class="flex align-center" href=https://github.com/itchingpixels/itchingpixels.github.io/commit/ff810bf07b7452df6d49cf4af4c2fbda434bd70b title="Last modified by Mark Aron Szulyovszky | 2020 Apr 19" target=_blank rel=noopener><img src=/svg/calendar.svg class=book-icon alt=Calendar>
