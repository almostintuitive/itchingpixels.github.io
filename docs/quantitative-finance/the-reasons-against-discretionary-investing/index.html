If something seems under- or overpriced to you, you probably don’t have all the info, and the market is most probably right.</p><p>3.

Even in hindsight, you’ll not be able to verify if the price went up or down because of your insight, or other factors. You can build up your ego in an up-market easily by seeing your assumptions frequently being validated, without benchmarking for total market returns or objectively evaluating the situation.</p><p>5. Mixing your personality (I like Crocs sandals, and their brand) with your investment decisions (therefore I’ll buy Crocs stock) is dangerous, as you can get into a situation where your ego is conflicting with your financial well-being. We’re all humans though - good luck detaching your personality from the rest of your decisions!</p><p>6. Everything that’s in the mainstream financial press is not worth your attention.</p></article><footer class=book-footer><div class="flex justify-between"><div><a class="flex align-center" href=https://github.com/itchingpixels/itchingpixels.github.io/commit/f00a5b8c21c1df8c1dde321b1231f6d8c5428cbb title="Last modified by Mark Aron Szulyovszky | 2020 Apr 19" target=_blank rel=noopener><img src=/svg/calendar.svg class=book-icon alt=Calendar>
