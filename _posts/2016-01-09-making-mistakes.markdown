title:  "Making mistakes"

For a long time, my profile said “I make complex simple”.

Well, first of all, it would be more accurate to say: "I try to make complex simple but I fail most of the time".

So, now that I’m there, it would be more accurate to say “I make lots of mistakes while trying to make complex simple”.

In short “I make mistakes."



So, from here and on, my profile will say that.

It’s extra convenient since I don’t ever have to think about whether it is still true or not ;).


Also, I hope this will help be more freely discuss my thoughts and ideas, that are obviously wrong anyway.

I hope this works!
