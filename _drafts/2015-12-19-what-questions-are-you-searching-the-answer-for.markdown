	How can I make this work?
“How do I make a network request"

	*How can I divide my large chunk of code into smaller components?*

“Okay, I can’t find what I’m looking for in this class, let’s impose a limit for the number of line per class (like 200), and they should be only responsible for one thing."

	*How can I create data structures that are better fit for the purpose?*
	
“Instead of 6 booleans, I can just have an enum representing this state, and also, these objects are related, and should reference each other this or that way."

	*How can I write code that’s easily testable?*

“Hmm it’s time to use dependency injection for this component, otherwise I’ll have to mock up the whole app to write just a single test case"

	*How can I deal with asynchronicity better?*

“Is this really the 8th callback I’m nesting here? What the hell? I’m sure there’s a simpler way, what does this term FRP stand for? Ohh, nice!!"

	*How can I avoid side effects as much as possible?*

“Can I refactor this component by composing functions and get rid of that property I was mutating before completely?” “Ohh Haskell is purely functional programming language? Let’s dig deeper into it…"

I guess I asked a few others in the meantime, but I feel like these were the most important ones since I started programming.

What were yours?
What keeps you occupied these days?
