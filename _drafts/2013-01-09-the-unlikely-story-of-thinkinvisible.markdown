Here is the story of a few unexpected events that changed my life:

10 months ago I was at my grandma’s place, looking for some inspiration. I needed some illustrations for my upcoming article for <a href="http://psychologicaldesign.net" target="_blank">Psychological Design</a> (a post I’ve never written, for a now ceased-to-exist blog - sssght).
I was browsing a book called <a href="http://uxmag.com/articles/100-things-every-designer-needs-to-know-about-people">100 Things Every Designer Should Know About People</a> when I first saw the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illusory_contours">Kanizsa Triangle</a>.

My first thought was: “that’s cool. does it work with other pictures, too?”. Surprisingly, the answer is yes, and it seemed liked nobody thought of that before (I have to tell, I still can't believe that;).
This was the first unlikely event, and there were a lot to follow...<!--more-->

So I started re-creating a bunch of the well-known iconic pictures that surrounds us, logos, cartoon characters, paintings - with Kanizsa's method.
For example, Bugs Bunny looks quite nice if you re-wrap it as an optical illusion:

<a href="http://itchingpixels.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/bugs-bunny-final-wtext-01.png" target="_blank"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-318" alt="Bugs Bunny" src="http://itchingpixels.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/bugs-bunny-final-wtext-01-212x300.png" width="212" height="300" /></a>

Around completing the 100th picture, I showed it my future co-founder, <a href="https://twitter.com/bodoradri">Adri</a>, whom I just met for the first time at a Startup Weekend. By the way, we won the pitching competition - but with another project. Nevertheless, we started working on how to create a whole brand based on this idea. Something I couldn't have done without her. From this point, I'm gonna use "we" instead of I, since we worked on it together closely.

After a lot of thinking and preparation, we launched it - with small success. It didn't really took off, and we didn't really know why. <a href="http://thinkinvisible.com" target="_blank">ThinkInvisible </a>was featured on a few design blogs, but that didn't really do the trick in our case.
Until.. we got on the first page of 9gag.
And it became a tipping point for the whole project - something I would never have thought of before. The third unlikely event.

Soon ThinkInvisible traveled around the world, the <a href="http://thinkinvisible.tumblr.com" target="_blank">tumblr blog</a> reached 100k visitors,we've got featured on more than 500 blogs. Among them, <a href="http://stallone-star.com/novosti-shoubiznesa/5900-podborka-minimalistskih-posterov-ot-think-invisible.html">this</a> is definitely the most bizarre one. It's the most unlikely place where you expect to find these pictures: on the Russian Sylvester Stallone fansite.

And it was so cool, because by that time, I didn’t even know how to use Photoshop! I hacked together the pictures with Illustrator &amp; Fireworks (I’ve got something to tell you: you should never use Fireworks. period.)
It was a big boost in every sense, I learned how to do an insane amount of stuff in a really short time period - it was both rewarding and fun at the same time.
And the whole process of searching for new pictures to "thinkinvisibilize", creating and testing them didn't really felt like work - the enthusiasm we had was the major driving force.

<strong>The first problem</strong>

Can you imagine how would you feel like if you were asked this question 20 times a day:
“What the hell is this?”
“What should I see?”

I was going mad... and we had to come up with something that can explains what ThinkInvisible is all about - in like 3 seconds.
After experimenting a bit with animation (for the first time, of course), I've created a small animgif that you can still see if you go to <a href="http://thinkinvisible.com" target="_blank">thinkinvisible.com</a> for the first time.

<a href="http://itchingpixels.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/animation.gif" target="_blank"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-319" alt="animation" src="http://itchingpixels.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/animation-212x300.gif" width="212" height="300" /></a>

(click on it)

That small tweak decreased the bounce rate we had on the website (it was quite high at the beginning) by 30%! Actually, I think we wouldn't have succeed without that 67Kb of ancient technology. (I think it can be easily classified as the fourth unlikely event.)
Of course, a lot of people still can't see what's hidden in the picture, and I'm really curious why is that and what's common in those people. If you have any idea, please <a href="mailto:mark.szulyovszky@gmail.com">drop me a line</a>!

<strong>The method</strong>

There are 3 types of ThinkInvisible pictures, can you spot the difference?

<a href="http://itchingpixels.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/hitchcock-final.png target="><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-320" alt="Hitchcock" src="http://itchingpixels.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/hitchcock-final-211x300.png" width="211" height="300" /></a>

This one only uses the silhouette of... a famous director, in this case.

<a href="http://itchingpixels.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/al-capone-final.png" target="_blank"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-321" alt="Al Capone" src="http://itchingpixels.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/al-capone-final-211x300.png" width="211" height="300" /></a>

This works with the outlines - there are a lot of things you wouldn't recognize only by their silhouette.

<a href="http://itchingpixels.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/audrey-hepburn-final.png" target="_blank"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-323" alt="Audrey Hepburn" src="http://itchingpixels.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/audrey-hepburn-final-211x300.png" width="211" height="300" /></a>

And the third one is a stripped down version of a detailed picture (a black &amp; white transformation does the trick)

In my experience, the first one is what really uses the Gestalt psychology, and it is the most fun, too.

We also had to find out whether people recognize the riddles or not - because it can quickly become frustrating if they are too difficult. There were 40-50 people regularly filling out forms and rating the pictures by their difficulty. I'm grateful for that and I hope they enjoyed it at least a little;).

<strong>Is this a game?</strong>

We didn’t really think of ThinkInvisible as a game at first - it was much more like an eye-candy than anything else. But the most fun I’ve had with the whole thing was when I saw my friends’ faces when they were about to guess a picture.
That feeling is so cool - everyone who doesn’t understand why game developers make games should experience it.
It seemed like it solving a picture provides a weird kind of reward, something that is usually property of a game.
Of course it wasn't me who drew the conclusion, one of my friends said one night that "it would be cool to make a mobile game out of it". No more words were needed.

<a href="https://twitter.com/bodoradri" target="_blank">Adri</a>, <a href="http://apppear.blogspot.hu/" target="_blank">Andras</a> (our programmer), and me shipped <a href="http://thinkinvisible.com/game" target="_blank">ThinkInvisible - The Game</a> for iOS (now it’s also available for Android &amp; Windows Phone - thanks to Peter Nagy &amp; Daniel Rusznyak) in two months. Honestly, I didn't even have an iOS device before - that's how experienced we all were 8 months ago... But more on that later!

All in all, I've just discovered something by random chance, randomly met someone a week later who became the co-founder of the project that was seen by millions of people because of a random 9gag submission.

Thanks to ThinkInvisible, I've got deeply involved into the startup community, organized <a href="http://planblabs.net" target="_blank">a team</a> that got into Europe's first gaming accelerator, created 4 apps in 6 months without any prior experience (<a href="http://learninvisible.com" target="_blank">one with a really ambitious goal</a>) and became a designer that I wanted to be.
I feel like I can't be luckier than I have been in the past 9 months. Let’s see what comes next;).
