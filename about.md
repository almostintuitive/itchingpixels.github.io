If we were to meet in person, I'd be more like: [what do you do?](mailto:mark.szulyovszky@gmail.com)

But fine, I'll tell you about myself.

Do you want to become a design intern or do you want to form your own company?
This was the question I faced right when I started. I did the latter.

Worth it? You bet.

With [PlanB Labs](http://planblabs.net) I've been through Europe's first [gaming accelerator](http://gamefounders.com), shipped 4 mobile games, including one that got more than 1 million downloads, [ThinkInvisible](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/thinkinvisible-the-game/id527215803?mt=8).

I needed more. I moved to London, started freelancing, etc etc.

Then I was like, "fuck I need to learn how to code".
It was so scary to even begin, but I *knew* I had to do it.

I started with Objective C for some reason (the usual: iOS).
Never start your coding career with Objective C. Never.

Although, for me, it was the most the most rewarding exerpience since I have started learning design - it basically opened up the world, and made it possibly to step out of the ["visual designer"](https://www.behance.net/cognitivemark) mindset I had.

Then I slowly became an engineer. I've got on this drug called building things. I love it.
I realised that playing around with technology is what I need to do.

I have a few stuff that I've built over the years. Tons of prototypes, and a few released apps, like [this](http://precrastinator.com), which is basically a new iteration of our previous language learning app, [LearnInvisible](http://learninvisible.com).
[Drops](http://planblabs.net/drops) got 150k downloads in its first 2 months, and I basically learnt what it means to write code that is running on tens of thousands of devices daily.

I've spent my last 12 months as an iOS developer / prototyper at [10to8](http://10to8.com) & [monitise create](http://monitisecreate.com). I'm currently contracting for a small startup to build [handpick.co](http://www.handpick.co/) from scratch.

What have I done before?
I was playing poker. Yeah, seriously.
I mean, profesionally. I did coaching, too. 
On the side, I've researched behavioral economics & cognitive psychology & wrote my thesis on the topic. I think these two are really connected. The research I've done at my uni helped me understand why people make bad decisions at the (virtual) poker table.

I'm not sure if anything here is relevant though. - it does feels like a quite random list of how I'm trying to push my boundaries.
