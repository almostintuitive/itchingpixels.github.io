# What's this?

It's a sort of personal (and public) wiki with random thoughts with various levels of quality and elaborateness. 

It's my alternative to a blog: I always struggled with publishing "production-ready" blog posts vs the number of drafts I have. Some, I'd love to have publish, but they were too short for a standalone post. Some, I admit I should never put a face of the internet. Nevertheless, chronological order is definitely inapproriate for most of the content of this site.
A wiki is my way to break this deadlock - to end up publishing more, and worry less about it. 

It's here for your entertainment, and for me, for reference.

PS: I wanted a .sushi domain for my site but thereâ€™s none available. Ping me if you also think this is outrageous so we can partner up to put some pressure ICANN!
