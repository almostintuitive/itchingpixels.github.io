# What's this?

It's a sort of personal (and public) wiki with random thoughts with various levels of quality and elaborateness.

It's my alternative to a blog: I always struggled with publishing "production-ready" blog posts vs the number of drafts I have. Some were too short for a standalone post. Some, I was too lazy to research in-depth. Nevertheless, chronological order is definitely inapproriate for most of the content of what I have here!

A wiki is my way to break this deadlock - to end up publishing more, and worry less about it.

It's here for your entertainment, and for me, for reference.

PS: I wanted a .sushi domain for my site but thereâ€™s none available. Ping me if you also think this is outrageous so we can partner up to put some pressure ICANN!


# Me 

If we were to meet in person, I'd be more like: [what do you do?](mailto:mark.szulyovszky@gmail.com)

But fine, let me show you this graph approximately describing my life / career so far:
