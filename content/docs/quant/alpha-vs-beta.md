# Alpha vs beta

Let's start with the definitions:

## Alpha
Excess returns you gain over the market.

- Only available to you.
- Requires you to have an edge (information that's not baked into the price already). 
- Zero-sum game. If you gain, somebody loses.
- Short-lived. As soon as the market finds about your edge, it'll arbitrage it away.

As a retail (non-institunioal) investor, your alpha (edge) sources are limited. Anything well-known is probably arbitraged away already (if it can be), by the time the info reaches you.

## Beta
Returns attributed to taking a ["risk premium"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_premium).

- Available for anyone.
- Doesn't require any edge.
- Non-zero sum game. You, and everyone else gains.
- Long-lived. As long as the vehicle / market works, it'll be available for everyone.

Beta can manifest itself in various ways:
- Seeking yield (eg. buying bonds)
- Value (eg. buying relatively cheap companies)
- Growth (eg. buying stocks that are on a good trajectory)
- Selling insurance (reducing someone else's exposure to volatility)

You can diversify your beta (risk premium) exposure with a market-cap weighted index fund, like the S&P 500, or an Aggregate Bond fund.
